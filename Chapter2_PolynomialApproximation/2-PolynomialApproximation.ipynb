    "> Joseph-Louis Lagrange is an Italian (who became French by the end of his life) mathematician and astronomer. He made significant contribution in analysis, number theory and both classical and celestial mechanics. He is one of the creators of the calculus of variations, which is a field of mathematical analysis that uses variations, which are small changes in functions and functionals, to find maxima and minima of functionals. He is best known for his contributions to mechanics (initiating a branch now called Lagragian mechanics), presenting the \"mechanical principles\" as a result of calculus of variations. Concerning calculus, he contributed to discover the importance of Taylor series (sometimes called Taylor-Lagrange series) and published in 1795 an interpolation method based on polynomials now called \"Lagrange polynomials\". Note that this interpolation method was already suggested in works of Edward Waring in 1779 and was a consequence of a formula published in 1783 by Leonhard Euler."

In the field of numerical analysis, he is the co-developper of the Runge-Kutta method to approximate the solution to differential equations. He discorvered the now called \"Runge's phenomenon\" in 1901 when exploring the behavior of errors when using polynomial interpolation to approximate certain functions. Runge's phenomenon is a problem of oscillation at the edges of an interval that occurs when using polynomial interpolation with polynomials of high degree over a set of equispaced interpolation points. The discovery was important because it shows that, for equispaced points, going to higher degrees does not always improve accuracy. The phenomenon is similar to the Gibbs phenomenon in Fourier series approximations."

    ">The method of least squares grew out of the fields of astronomy and geodesy, as scientists and mathematicians sought to provide solutions to the challenges of navigating the Earth's oceans. To do so, the accurate description of the behavior of celestial bodies was the key to enabling ships to sail in open seas, where sailors could no longer rely on land sightings for navigation. A seminal method, called the method of average, was used for example by the French scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace to study the motion of Jupiter and Saturn. The first clear and concise exposition of the method of least squares was published by the French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805 (no portrait known apart from this caricature...). In 1809, the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss published his method of calculating the orbits of celestial bodies. In that work he claimed to have been in possession of the method of least squares since 1795. This naturally led to a priority dispute with Legendre. However, to Gauss's credit, he went beyond Legendre and succeeded in connecting the method of least squares with the principles of probability and to the normal distribution."

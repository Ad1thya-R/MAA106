In one dimension, we present and analyze elementary quadrature rules, link them with polynomial interpolation, and see how they can be used to provide composite quadrature rules. Then, we present a non-deterministic approach to compute integrals which can easily be adapted to compute volumes in 3 dimensions. These methods are tested to solve three problems."

    "> Nicholas Constantine Metropolis is a Greek-American physicist. In the 1950s, a group of researchers led by Metropolis, including John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam, developed the Monte Carlo method. This term describes a broad class of algorithms relying on random sampling. The basic idea is to use randomness to solve deterministic problems. These kind of methods are now widely used, for instance in optimization, integration and probability."
